Note: You must also install [Location Map Viewer](https://f-droid.org/packages/de.k3b.android.locationMapViewer) to display the results.

This app adds the option *Show Articles in Map* to any app that can shown/send/share a geo location or **geo-uri** .

This app hooks into the android system to intercept "view geo-uri". When getting a geo-uri it asks wikipedia and shows the results in
[Location Map Viewer](https://f-droid.org/packages/de.k3b.android.locationMapViewer)
(or in any other installed app that understands the format 'kmz').

*Location Map Viewer* shows a map with bubbles (or article-icons if enabled/available) for every wikipedia article found.

If you click on a bubble you get a popup with a short article description and a button that links to the full article.

Here are some f-droid apps that are compatible with *Show Articles in Map*

* navigation: [OsmAnd](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.osmand.plus/),
* public transportation: [Transportr](https://f-droid.org/packages/de.grobox.liberario) or [oeffi](https://f-droid.org/packages/de.schildbach.oeffi)
* translate postal address to geo [Acastus Photon ](https://f-droid.org/packages/name.gdr.acastus_photon)
* Share your current position [LocationShare](https://f-droid.org/packages/ca.cmetcalfe.locationshare) or [My Position](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.mypapit.mobile.myposition)
